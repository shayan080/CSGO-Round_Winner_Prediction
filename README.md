# CSGO-Round_Winner_Prediction
In this project, we built a machine learning model to predict the winner of a round in the popular video game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. We trained and evaluated five different models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Network.
